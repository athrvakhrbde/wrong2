Question: "Behenchaara", why are you reading this for the first time? Atharva is damn sure, you've never heard of this word before. 

P.S. - Don't tell Atharva "sisterhood is already a word", it doesn't have the same weight equalling "bhaichaara".  

Unlike male to male friendships, according to Atharva, female friendships lack bhaichaara, literally because "bhai" refers to males, & figuratively because females don't stand with their mates the way men do. Atharva doesn't want to elaborate on this & get cancelled on Twitter.

## Key Points

1. **Testosterone = Unconditional Support**
2. **Estrogen = Warmth**

Atharva once asked for some money to a buddy of his, & the buddy sent twice the amount asked. This is bhaichaara on top. 

When Atharva told this to his friend who's much older & wiser than him, thus giving substantial weight to her words, she told him that she has never seen "bhaichaara" in women. 

If a guy gets into a fight, it's highly liked he can pull up a whole ass gang in minutes to tackle the scene. 

> Fighting is not a good thing, bad, very bad. But when you need your homie, he'll come.

Due to Atharva's limited interaction with female human species, he cannot & doesn't want to comment more. He might be wrong, but this is what he has to say.
