  - Not Atharva

Alone, bored, lonely even, he’s sitting at a cafe, Atharva, just taking it all in.

An hour later, he’s tryna get into the conversation with a bunch of his acquaintances, patiently listening to corporate gossip, marriage banter between a couple, etc., etc.

He puts on his earbuds, blasts some music, and walks away.

Irritated, yet at solace with his own company, he figures it’s better than not being mentally present while physically being there.

He’s adopted this protocol for himself, wherein he’d rather be alone than stuck in distasteful company.

Another tangent, similar scenario, he’s calling people around him for some no-agenda chit-chat, as well as some brainstorming. No positive response.

“Man, fuck off,” he mutters under his breath. He’s better off alone for the time being, and he knows it.

On the flipside, there are people who are welcoming, warm, wholesome, and all ears. He’d rather hang out with them.

Nobody’s so busy, it’s just a matter of priorities, he reckons.
He’s happy to let go of these people.

Call it arrogance or ego, he doesn’t even step into restaurants/cafes that aren’t welcoming.

The peace of choosing solitude, and the joy of being with people who truly value him, is immeasurable to Atharva. This aligns perfectly with his thesis on boundaries, mental health, and self-respect.

Similar shit happens with founders, some are responsive and high-agency, others are just loose, and he sees it clear as day.

If you think he’s not worth your time, he won’t put in the effort to follow up anymore.

He might be wrong, but he values authenticity, his mental health, and boundaries more than how big a shot the other person is.
