Question: "Behenchaara", why are you reading this for the first time? Atharva is damn sure, you've never heard of this word before.

P.S. - Don't tell Atharva "sisterhood is already a word", it doesn't have the same weight equalling "bhaichaara".

Unlike male to male friendships, according to Atharva, female friendships lack bhaichaara, literally because "bhai" refers to males, & figuratively because females don't stand with their mates the way men do. Atharva doesn't want to elaborate on this & get cancelled on Twitter.

Testosterone = Unconditional Support Estrogen = Warmth

Atharva once asked for some money to a buddy of his, & the buddy sent twice the amount asked. This is bhaichaara on top.

When Atharva told this to his friend's mom, she didn't understand this & got scared.
